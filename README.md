# Analysis-of-Messi-Football-Performance
- Webscraping project using excel to analyse Messi performance for country and club.
- Using Excel, I webscraped Messi football data from Wikipedia using following link: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi).
- I then loaded the data to power query for cleaning and transformation.
- I created different visuals to show Messi appearances, goals, and goals per games ratio for club and country.
- The following is the dashboard for Messi club performance:
